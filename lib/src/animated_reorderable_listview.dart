  /// - `SizeAnimation()`: Gradually animates the size of the item.

  /// - `SlideInUp()`: A sliding animation from the bottom to the top.
  /// - `SlideInDown()`: A sliding animation from the top to the bottom.
  ///
  /// ### Custom Animations
  /// In addition to the predefined animations listed above, you can create custom configurations
  /// for each animation to suit your specific needs. For example, you can adjust the duration,
  /// curve, or other parameters for finer control:
  /// ```dart
  /// enterTransition: [
